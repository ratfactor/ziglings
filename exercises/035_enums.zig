//
// Remember that little mathematical virtual machine we made using the
// "unreachable" statement?  Well, there were two problems with the
// way we were using op codes:
//
//   1. Having to remember op codes by number is no good.
//   2. We had to use "unreachable" because Zig had no way of knowing
//      how many valid op codes there were.
//
// An "enum" is a Zig construct that lets you give names to numeric
// values and store them in a set. They look a lot like error sets:
//
//     const Fruit = enum{ apple, pear, orange };
//
//     const my_fruit = Fruit.apple;
//
// Let's use an enum in place of the numbers we were using in the
// previous version!
//
const std = @import("std");

// Please complete the enum!
