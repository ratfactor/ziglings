// We've absorbed a lot of information about the variations of types
// we can use in Zig. Roughly, in order we have:
//
//                          u8  single item
//                         *u8  single-item pointer
//                        []u8  slice (size known at runtime)
//                       [5]u8  array of 5 u8s
//                       [*]u8  many-item pointer (zero or more)
//                 enum {a, b}  set of unique values a and b
//                error {e, f}  set of unique error values e and f
//      struct {y: u8, z: i32}  group of values y and z
// union(enum) {a: u8, b: i32}  single value either u8 or i32
//
// Values of any of the above types can be assigned as "var" or "const"
// to allow or disallow changes (mutability) via the assigned name:
//
//     const a: u8 = 5; // immutable
//       var b: u8 = 5; //   mutable
//
// We can also make error unions or optional types from any of
// the above:
//
//     var a: E!u8 = 5; // can be u8 or error from set E
//     var b: ?u8 = 5;  // can be u8 or null
//
// Knowing all of this, maybe we can help out a local hermit. He made
// a little Zig program to help him plan his trips through the woods,
// but it has some mistakes.

// Going deeper:

// In computer science terms, our map places are "nodes" or "vertices" and

// graph". It is "weighted" because each path has a distance (also
// known as a "cost"). It is "directed" because each path goes FROM
// one place TO another place (undirected graphs allow you to travel
// on an edge in either direction).
//
// Since we append new notebook entries at the end of the list and
// then explore each sequentially from the beginning (like a "todo"
// list), we are treating the notebook as a "First In, First Out"
// (FIFO) queue.
//
// Since we examine all closest paths first before trying further ones
// (thanks to the "todo" queue), we are performing a "Breadth-First
// Search" (BFS).
//
// By tracking "lowest cost" paths, we can also say that we're
// performing a "least-cost search".
//
// Even more specifically, the Hermit's Notebook most closely
// resembles the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA), attributed to
// Edward F. Moore. By replacing our simple FIFO queue with a
// "priority queue", we would basically have Dijkstra's algorithm. A
// priority queue retrieves items sorted by "weight" (in our case, it
// would keep the paths with the shortest distance at the front of the
// queue). Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient because longer paths
// can be eliminated more quickly. (Work it out on paper to see why!)
