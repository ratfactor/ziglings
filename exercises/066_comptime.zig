//
// "Compile time" is a program's environment while it is being
// compiled. In contrast, "run time" is the environment while the
// compiled program is executing (traditionally as machine code
// on a hardware CPU).
//
// Errors make an easy example:
//
// 1. Compile-time error: caught by the compiler, usually
//    resulting in a message to the programmer.
//
// 2. Runtime error: either caught by the running program itself
//    or by the host hardware or operating system. Could be
//    gracefully caught and handled or could cause the computer
//    to crash (or halt and catch fire)!
//
// All compiled languages must perform a certain amount of logic
// at compile time in order to analyze the code, maintain a table
// of symbols (such as variable and function names), etc.
//
// Optimizing compilers can also figure out how much of a program
// can be pre-computed or "inlined" at compile time to make the
// resulting program more efficient. Smart compilers can even
// "unroll" loops, turning their logic into a fast linear
// sequence of statements (at the usually very slight expense of
// the increased size of the repeated code).
//
// Zig takes these concepts further by making these optimizations
// an integral part of the language itself!
//
