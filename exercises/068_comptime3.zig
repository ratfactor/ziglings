// than crashing at runtime.

// contains a complete format string parser that runs entirely at
// compile time!)

// What would happen if you DID attempt to build a model in the

//
//    A) You're already done!

//    C) You would construct a singularity and destroy the
//       planet.
//
// And how about a model in the scale of 0:1?
//
//    A) You're already done!
//    B) You'd arrange nothing carefully into the form of the
//       original nothing but infinitely larger.
//    C) You would construct a singularity and destroy the
//       planet.
