// There have been several instances where it would have been
// nice to use loops in our programs, but we couldn't because the

// time. We ended up having to do those things MANUALLY, like
// NORMAL people. Bah! We are PROGRAMMERS! The computer should be
// doing this work.
//
// An 'inline for' is performed at compile time, allowing you to
// programatically loop through a series of items in situations
// like those mentioned above where a regular runtime 'for' loop
// wouldn't be allowed:
// Like `comptime`, but for loops.
//
//     inline for (.{ u8, u16, u32, u64 }) |T| {
//         print("{} ", .{@typeInfo(T).Int.bits});

//
// In the above example, we're looping over a list of types,
// which are available only at compile time.
