// We haven't discussed it yet, but runtime "safety" features
// require some extra instructions in your compiled program.
// Most of the time, you're going to want to keep these in.
//
// But in some programs, when data integrity is less important
// than raw speed (some games, for example), you can compile
// without these safety features.
//
// Instead of a safe panic when something goes wrong, your
// program will now exhibit Undefined Behavior (UB), which simply
// means that the Zig language does not (cannot) define what will
// happen. The best case is that it will crash, but in the worst
// case, it will continue to run with the wrong results and
// corrupt your data or expose you to security risks.
//
// This program is a great way to explore UB. Once you get it
// working, try calling the getBeef() function with the value
// 0xDEAD so that it will invoke the 'suspend' keyword:
//
//     getBeef(0xDEAD)
//
// Now when you run the program, it will panic and give you a
// nice stack trace to help debug the problem.
//
//     zig run exercises/090_async7.zig
//     thread 328 panic: async function called...
//     ...
//
// But see what happens when you turn off safety checks by using
// ReleaseFast mode:
//
//     zig run -O ReleaseFast exercises/090_async7.zig
//     beef? 0!
//
// This is the wrong result. On your computer, you may get a
// different answer or it might crash! What exactly will happen
// is UNDEFINED. Your computer is now like a wild animal,
// reacting to bits and bytes of raw memory with the base
// instincts of the CPU. It is both terrifying and exhilarating.
