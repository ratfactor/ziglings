//
// Remember our ant and bee simulator constructed with unions
// back in exercises 55 and 56? There, we demonstrated that
// unions allow us to treat different data types in a uniform
// manner.
//
// One neat feature was using tagged unions to create a single
// function to print a status for ants *or* bees by switching:
//
//   switch (insect) {
//      .still_alive => ...      // (print ant stuff)
//      .flowers_visited => ...  // (print bee stuff)
//   }
//
// Well, that simulation was running just fine until a new insect
// arrived in the virtual garden, a grasshopper!
//
// Doctor Zoraptera started to add grasshopper code to the
// program, but then she backed away from her keyboard with an
// angry hissing sound. She had realized that having code for
// each insect in one place and code to print each insect in
// another place was going to become unpleasant to maintain when
// the simulation expanded to hundreds of different insects.
//
// Thankfully, Zig has another comptime feature we can use
// to get out of this dilemma called the 'inline else'.
//
// We can replace this redundant code:
//
//   switch (thing) {
//       .a => |a| special(a),
//       .b => |b| normal(b),
//       .c => |c| normal(c),
//       .d => |d| normal(d),
//       .e => |e| normal(e),
//       ...
//   }
//
// With:
//
//   switch (thing) {
//       .a => |a| special(a),
//       inline else => |t| normal(t),
//   }
//
// We can have special handling of some cases and then Zig
// handles the rest of the matches for us.
//
// With this feature, you decide to make an Insect union with a
// single uniform 'print()' function. All of the insects can
// then be responsible for printing themselves. And Doctor
// Zoraptera can calm down and stop gnawing on the furniture.
//

// Our print() method in the Insect union above demonstrates
// something very similar to the object-oriented concept of an
// abstract data type. That is, the Insect type doesn't contain
// the underlying data, and the print() function doesn't
// actually do the printing.
//
// The point of an interface is to support generic programming:
// the ability to treat different things as if they were the
// same to cut down on clutter and conceptual complexity.
//
// The Daily Insect Report doesn't need to worry about *which*
// insects are in the report - they all print the same way via
// the interface!
//
// Doctor Zoraptera loves it.
